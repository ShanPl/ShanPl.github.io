        <h3> TECHNICAL PROJECTS</h3>
        <h4>DAC - Digital to Analog Converter</h4>
        •	Designed a 4-bit DAC circuit on paper, simulated using LTSpice, created a 1” PCB schematic, ordered PCB from OSH Park, soldered all components to chip, tested thoroughly with Analog Discovery 2 <br>
        •	Designed a separate voltage level shifting circuit, connected with DAC, Arduino Uno (for ADC), and phone, and speakers. DAC was used to play songs from phone in 4-bit. <br>
        <br>
        <h4>BASYS-3 Board Projects</h4>
        •	Using SystemVerilog, programmed the BASYS3 board to controls a traffic light system. Buttons were used to represent pressure sensors under the road for waiting cars, and a VGA screen displayed the intersection, waiting cars, and current traffic light colors. <br>
        •	Using SystemVerilog and Verilog, programmed the BASYS3 board to be able to run any RISC-V code. Full OTTER assembler manual was implemented. Some Verilog modules designed include the Memory, Control Status Register, Control Unit, Finite State Machine, Decoders, Registers, Multiplexers, ect. <br>
        •	Using RISC-V code run on the BASYS-3 board, a two player game was designed where one person navigates the character while the other person tries to stop them with timed button presses.
